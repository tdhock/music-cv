Band, and with the 10-piece political activism street band, Brass
Liberation Orchestra. In 2008-2012 he lived in Paris, France where he
played alto and baritone sax with Les Fines Pôlettes, a 15-piece
fanfare (French brass band). In 2013 he lived in Tokyo, Japan where he
played baritone sax with Los Guaracheros, the latin jazz big band of
the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 2014-2018 he lived in Montreal,

** [[http://therff.free.fr/][La RFF]], Paris, France 2009-2012, alto and bari sax

The official brass band (fanfare) of [[https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/][Mines
ParisTech]], which was one of my academic affiliations during my
PhD. Unlike the other fanfares I played with, this one is mostly
composed of current students of the school (and some alumni). This
fanfare has a repertoire of "saucisson" songs which means "sausage"
(songs that everybody knows/plays). I went on several fun train trips
with this band, including to Toulouse, Montpellier, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Jean-de-Luz][St-Jean-de-Luz]]
for the Tuna Festival.

** Shtarak Nikov, Paris, France, 2008-2009, alto sax

This band was my introduction to the sub-culture of [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanfare_des_Beaux-Arts][French brass bands
(fanfares)]], which is very different from the American tradition. One
difference is that the French fanfares are much smaller (10-20
musicians) than the American university marching bands (100-200
musicians). Another difference is that in some of the [[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole][Grande Ecoles]], a
new fanfare is formed each year among freshmen, who may stay playing
together after graduation. These students typically do not have any
prior musical experience, so it may take quite some time to build a
repertoire / learn songs (usually by ear). This band practiced at the
[[https://www.ensad.fr/][Ecole Nationale Superiere des Arts Decoratifs (ENSAD)]], and notable
performances include a battle of the ENSAD brass bands at the [[http://www.cabaretsauvage.com/][Cabaret
Sauvage]] (Spring 2009?), and opening for [[https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-slackers/2009/universite-paris-ix-dauphine-paris-france-3c7fd6f.html][The Slackers at a festival at
Université Paris IX Dauphine]] (May 2009, actually in my memory, the
concert was at Nanterre).
